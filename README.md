# Webpack Starters for reference

A collection of different Webpack setups for quick referencing or starting from.

_NOTE: Typically the `build` folder is ignored in git, but for demonstrations purposes I've left it tracked._

## Start using for a new project, or playground

1. Clone the repo
2. Select the branch you want
3. Run `npm i` to install dependencies
4. Run one of the following commands, depending on intent:

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```


### Development Build, watching for file changes

```bash
npm run watch
```

### Development Server on port :3000

```bash
npm start
```
